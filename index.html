        <p class="text">
          Adventures include making happy memories. These memories can be
          cherished and looked up to in time of distress. Going out on a short
          trip with friends is exciting. Adventure camps are regularly initiated
          by several schools. The students who are involved in these activities
          are generally guides and scouts. The activities involved are adventure
          camps, bonfires and tent activities. Some of the activities that are
          considered adventurous can be listed. Water activities like zorbing,
          skiing in the water are fun. Fishing can be a fun activity for many.
          Some might find hiking to unknown places adventurous. Adventure is
          mostly related to knowing the unknown. It gives the person hope to
          look at something new and exciting.

          A bonfire is an excellent beginning for adventures. A warm cup of hot
          chocolate and bonfire dances are great forms of enjoyment for the
          vagabond heart. Playing instruments can be considered as a fun
          activity during a bonfire. The escape from the mundane activities of
          life instigates the thirst for Adventure.

          benefits. It also varies in intensity, so it’s suitable for all

          Riding a bike is fairly simple. If you have difficulty with a standard
          bicycle, stationary bikes are a great alternative. If you’re new to
          fitness or bouncing back from an injury or illness, you can cycle at a
          low intensity. As you get more fit, you can increase the intensity or
          continue to cycle at a chill pace. Studies have shown that even

        <p class="text">
          Paragliding is a sport in which the players fly in the air using
          paragliders. These paragliders are light in weight and are foot
          launched. There is a harness in the glider on which the paraglider
          sits. This harness is interconnected to the glider with baffled cells.
          We will learn various aspects of this adventurous in the chapters that

          <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Surfing was invented by the Polynesians at least 4000 years ago. It
          has become a popular sport among both men and women of all ages. With
          lifestyles and regimens freer than those of most sports, surfers
          comprise a unique culture. Though surfing is practiced in many other
          Pacific nations, its center remains Hawaii, where many rounds of the
          international surfing championships (the ASP) are held annually.
          Surfing is popular in Australia, the US, and Northern Europe.
          <br />
          <br />
          According to the University of Hawaii, bodysurfing dates back as far
          back as 2,000 BC, but the first evidence of bodysurfing activity in
          the Western world only emerged in 1899, when Australian Fred Williams
          got a few lessons from Polynesian islander Tommy Tana. The origins of
          the pastime can be traced back to the ancient Polynesian culture,
          specifically in the islands of Hawaii, where it was called "Heenalu"
          by the natives.
